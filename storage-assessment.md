Contextual Information
Note: may be out of date
Geodata: Number of datasets is few, datasets are large 
Arizona data:
Entire grid for one year is 1.2 TB
Arizona State Lands bought it from Department of Agriculture, state has to purchase it and then
AZL has 2017 (3.7 because higher resolution, 2019 will be the same )
We have 2007, 2010, 2013, 2015 
Arizona NAIP data: 
2005, 2007, 2010, 2013 - regional (we must keep this)
Other: 
Pima Associates for Government
Currently lives on imagery.library
Links on this site are linking directly from that filesystem
15-20 datasets 300GB each 
We purchase this from PAG
